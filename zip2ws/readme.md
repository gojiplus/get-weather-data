### zip2ws: Find weather stations 'nearest' to zip codes

#### What it does: 
1. Finds (certain kinds of) weather stations "nearest" (within a certain distance, or X number of closest) to each zip code centroid
2. Finds centroids of zip codes using Google API 

#### Additional Details
Weather stations come in lots of varieties. We limit ourselves to weather stations of the following four kinds:  

1. [GHCND stations list](inventories/ghcnd-stations.txt). For current list, see:
   [NCDC GHCND Stations List](http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt)
   
2. [ASOS stations list](asos-stations.txt). For current list, see:
   [NCDC ASOS Stations List](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/homr/file/asos-stations.txt)
   
3. [COOP stations list (Active only)](coop-act.txt). For current list, see:
   [NCDC COOP Stations List](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/inventories/COOP-ACT.TXT)
   
4. [USAF-WBAN stations list](ish-history.csv). For current list, see:
   [NCDC ISH Stations List](http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ish/ish-history.csv)

#### Fields
* `zip, lat, long, city, state, zipcodetype, locationtype, location, decommisioned, taxreturns, estimatedpopulation, totalwages` from [federalgovernmentzipcodes.us](http://federalgovernmentzipcodes.us/free-zipcode-database-Primary.csv): 
* gm_lat/gm_long: lat./long. of centroids of zip codes via Google API. 
* diff: distance in meters between Google API estimated centroid of zip code and lat/long that comes with the database.
* list of stations: ordered from closest to furthest
* stX_id: station id
* stX_name: name of station
* stX_distance: distance to zip centroid

#### Running the script

To run the script, you will need to install two Python libraries:

* [pygeocoder](https://bitbucket.org/xster/pygeocoder/wiki/Home)
   To install, you can simply use: `$ pip install pygeocoder`
   
* [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
   To install, you can simply user: `$ pip install requests`

**Note** Don't forget the inventories directory  that contains the station files and zip csv that is imported. The inventories folder should be in the same folder as the script.

Usage: zip2ws.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -D DATABASE, --database=DATABASE
                        Database name (default: zip2ws.sqlite)
  -i, --import          Create and import database
  -g, --geocode         Query and update Lat/Lon by Google Maps Geocoding API
  -c, --closest         Calculate and update closest table
  --ghcn=GHCN           Number of closest stations for GHCN (default: 3)
  --coop=COOP           Number of closest stations for COOP (default: 1)
  --usaf=USAF           Number of closest stations for USAF (default: 1)
  -d DISTANCE, --distance=DISTANCE
                        Maximum distance of stations from Zip location
                        (Default: 0)
  -e, --export          Export closest stations for each Zip to CSV file
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile=OUTFILE
                        CSV Output file name (default: zip-stations.csv)
  --drop-closest        Drop closet table
  --clear-glatlon       Clear Google Maps Geocoding API Lat/Lon
  --use-zlatlon         Use Zip Lat/Lon instead of Google Geocoding Lat/Lon

</code></pre>

Start using the script by creating and importing the database.
Do so by running:
<pre>python zip2ws.py -i</pre>
	
Next task is to update the closest weather stations table. This you can do by executing...
<pre>python zip2ws.py -c</pre>

This task uses the Google lat/long. If you want them to use other lat/long, 
<pre>python zip2ws.py -c --use-zlatlon</pre>

**NOTE:** If you interrupt the script inbetween and restart it again, the script will start processing from where it left off. 

If you want to find a set number of closest stations, specify the type and number of weather stations. For instance, to find 5 GHCND statons, 3 COOP stations, and 2 USAF stations, run: 
<pre>  python zip2ws.py -c --ghcn=5 --coop=3 --usaf=2 </pre> 

To find all weather stations within 30KM and organized by closest to furthest,
<pre>   python zip2ws.py -c -d 30 </pre>
    
To export results to a CSV file, "closest.csv", run..
<pre>  python zip2ws.py -e -o closest.csv </pre>

To find out centroids of zip codes using Google Maps Geocoding API, use
<pre>python zip2ws.py -g</pre>

Keep in mind that Google Maps Geocoding API usage limit is 2,500 Query/Day/IP Address. So you can quickly run into the limit. The script will raise the exception "OVER_QUERY_LIMIT" if the limit is breached. But do not fear. You can run the script multiple times to code a greater number of zip codes. If you are unahppy with the results, use the option: --clear-glatlon 
to clear exist data.
